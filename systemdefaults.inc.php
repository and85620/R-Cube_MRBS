//
// Note that timezones can be set on a per-area basis, so strictly speaking this
// setting should be in areadefaults.inc.php, but as it is so important to set
// the right timezone it is included here.
//
// When upgrading an existing installation, this should be set to the
// timezone the web server runs in.  See the INSTALL document for more information.

// Saving Time transitions.    This information is included in the MRBS distribution.
// However, as governments can change the rules periodically, MRBS will check from
// time to time to see if there is a later version available on the web.   If your

/*******************
 * Themes
 *******************/

// Choose a theme for the MRBS.   The theme controls two aspects of the look and feel:
//   (a) the styling:  the most commonly changed colours, dimensions and fonts have been 
//       extracted from the main CSS file and put into the styling.inc file in the appropriate
//       directory in the Themes directory.   If you want to change the colour scheme, you should
//       be able to do it by changing the values in the theme file.    More advanced styling changes
//       can be made by changing the rules in the CSS file.
//   (b) the header:  the header.inc file which contains the function used for producing the header.
//       This enables organisations to plug in their own header functions quite easily, in cases where
//       the desired corporate look and feel cannot be changed using the CSS alone and the mark-up
//       itself needs to be changed.
//
//  MRBS will look for the files "styling.inc" and "header.inc" in the directory Themes/$theme and
//  if it can't find them will use the files in Themes/default.    A theme directory can contain
//  a replacement styling.inc file or a replacement header.inc file or both.

// Available options are:

// "default"        Default MRBS theme
// "classic126"     Same colour scheme as MRBS 1.2.6

$theme = "default";

// Use the $custom_css_url to override the standard MRBS CSS.
//$custom_css_url = 'css/custom.css';


/*******************
 * Calendar settings
 *******************/
 
// MRBS has two different modes of operation: "times" and "periods".   "Times"
// based bookings allow you to define regular consecutive booking slots, eg every
// half an hour from 7.00 am to 7.00 pm.   "Periods" based bookings are useful
// in, for example, schools where the booking slots are of different lengths
// and are not consecutive because of change-over time or breaks.

// It is not possible to swap between these two options once bookings have
// been created and to have meaningful entries.  This is due to differences
// in the way that the data is stored.

// It is however possible to configure the system so that some areas operate in
// "periods" mode and others in "times" mode.    Therefore the configuration variable
// that determines the default setting for new areas appears together with other
// variables that can be set on a per-area basis in the file areadefaults.inc.php.
// This is done to draw attention to the fact that they are default settings for new
// areas only and to avoid frustration when trying to change settings for existing
// areas: this is done by editing the settings for an area using a web browser by
// following the "Rooms" link in MRBS.


// GENERAL SETTINGS
// ----------------

// This is the maximum number of rows (timeslots or periods) that one can
// expect to see in the day and week views.    It is used by mrbs.css.php for
// creating classes.    It does not matter if it is too large, except for the
// fact that more CSS than necessary will be generated.  (The variable is ignored
// if $times_along_top is set to true).

$max_slots = 60;


// TIMES SETTINGS
// --------------

// The times settings can all be configured on a per-area basis, so these variables
// appear in the areadefaults.inc.php file.


// PERIODS SETTINGS
// ----------------

// The "Periods" settings are used only in areas where the mode has
// been set to "Periods".

// format tablename.columnname.    For example to restrict the name of a booking
// to 'Physics', 'Chemistry' or 'Biology' uncomment the line below.

// At the moment $select_options is only supported as follows:
//     - Entry table: name, description and custom fields
//     - Users table: custom fields

// For custom fields only (will be extended later) it is also possible to use

//                                          'h' => 'Hot Lunch');

// In this case the key (eg 'c') is stored in the database, but the value
// (eg 'Coffee') is displayed and can be searched for using Search and Report.
// This allows you to alter the displayed values, for example changing 'Coffee'
// to 'Coffee, Tea and Biscuits', without having to alter the database.   It can also
// be useful if the database table is being shared with another application.
// MRBS will auto-detect whether the array is associative.
//
// Note that an array such as
//
// $select_options['entry.catering'] = array('2' => 'Coffee', 
//                                           '4' => 'Sandwiches',
//                                           '5' => 'Hot Lunch');

// will be treated as a simple indexed array rather than as an associative array.
// That's because (a) strictly speaking PHP does not distinguish between indexed
// and associative arrays and (b) PHP will cast any string key that looks like a
// valid integer into an integer.
