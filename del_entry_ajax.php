// A version of del_entry.php designed to be used in Ajax POST calls.  It
// takes an array of ids to be deleted as input.   These are always assumed
// to be single entries.   Returns the number of entries deleted, or some
// kind of string on failure (most likely a login page)
//
// If deleting lots of entries you may need to split the Ajax requests into
// multiple smaller requests in order to avoid exceeding the system limit 
// for POST requests, and also the limit on the size of the SQL query once
// the ids are imploded.
//
// Note that:
// (1) the code assumes that you are an admin with powers to delete anything.
//     It checks that you are an admin and so does not bother checking that
//     you have rights in that particular area or room, nor does it check that
//     the proposed deletion conforms to any policy in force.
// (2) email notifications are not sent, even if they are normally configured
//     to be sent.   Sending many thousands of emails in the space of a few
//     seconds could overwhelm many mail servers, or break the usage policies
//     on hosted systems.

// Everything looks OK - go ahead and delete the entries

// Note on performance.   It is much quicker to delete entries using the
// WHERE id IN method below than looping through mrbsDelEntry().  Testing
// for 100 entries gave 2.5ms for the IN method against 37.6s for the looping
// method - ie approx 15 times faster.   For 1,000 rows the IN method was 19
// times faster.
//
// Because we are not using mrbsDelEntry() we have to delete any orphaned
// rows in the repeat table ourselves - but this does not take long.

$sql = "DELETE FROM $tbl_entry WHERE id IN (" . implode(',', $ids) . ")";

// And delete any orphaned rows in the repeat table
